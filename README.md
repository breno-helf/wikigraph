# WikiGraph
Query distances between portuguese Wikipedia articles.

This is a personal project to deal with some simple and cool data structures.

The app is powered by Node.js and Express framework.

The heavy part is written in C++ and imported as an addon in Node. To fetch Wikipedia data, I used a
Python script and the Wikimedia API (it takes a lot to download everything right now).

*The code is absolutely barbaric and in portuguese. I'm sorry for that.*

It should be easy to port it to any language you want, but **ENGLISH IS HUGE**. Feel free to contact me.
